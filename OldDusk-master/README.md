# OldDusk
Formerly known as K-Script, OldDusk is a way of creating text based games with as little code as possible.

# What is this
This project is a newer version of K-Script. (K-Script is now in the Legacy folder) This project will be utilised in sometime soon.

# So, how do I use this?
it's currently in development and doesn't function very well (I'm learning C++ currently and I plan to port this soon.)
